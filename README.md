Below is a list of error codes that can be returned **on iOS**:

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `useState()` | Authentication was not successful because the user failed to provide valid credentials. |
| `useEffect()` | Authentication was canceled by the user—for example, the user tapped Cancel in the dialog. |
| `useParams()` | Authentication was canceled because the user tapped the fallback button (Enter Password). |
| `useHistory()` | Authentication was canceled by system—for example, if another application came to foreground while the authentication dialog was up. |
| `fetch()` | Authentication could not start because the passcode is not set on the device. |
| `axios()` | Authentication could not start because Touch ID is not available on the device |
| `props, destructure` | Authentication could not start because Touch ID has no enrolled fingers. |
| `Show conditional img` | Could not authenticate for an unknown reason. |
